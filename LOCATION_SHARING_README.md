## Usage

### For Drivers

#### Starting Location Sharing
1. Open the Bus Tracker Manager app
2. Navigate to Dashboard ‚Üí Location Sharing
3. Toggle the "Location Sharing" switch ON
4. Grant location permissions if prompted
5. Location will start sharing automatically

#### Viewing Location Data
- **Current Location**: Real-time coordinates and accuracy
- **Location History**: Complete history of all location updates
- **Route Progress**: Number of stops completed
- **Nearby Stops**: Stops within 100 meters

#### Stopping Location Sharing
1. Toggle the "Location Sharing" switch OFF
2. Location sharing stops immediately
3. Last known location is cleared from Firebase

### For Parents/Administrators

#### Viewing Driver Location
- Real-time location updates in parent/student apps
- Driver status (active/inactive)
- Last seen timestamp
- Route progress information

## Technical Implementation

### Permissions Required
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```

### Firebase Database Structure
```
drivers/
  {driverId}/
    currentLocation/
      latitude: double
      longitude: double
      accuracy: float
      speed: float
      bearing: float
      timestamp: long
      isActive: boolean
    locationHistory/
      {locationId}/
        [same structure as currentLocation]
    lastSeen: long
    isSharingLocation: boolean
```

### Location Update Intervals
- **Minimum Time**: 5 seconds between updates
- **Minimum Distance**: 10 meters movement threshold
- **Share Interval**: 10 seconds maximum between Firebase uploads
- **Battery Optimization**: Adaptive intervals based on movement

### Accuracy Settings
- **GPS Priority**: High accuracy GPS when available
- **Network Fallback**: Network location when GPS unavailable
- **Accuracy Threshold**: Updates only when accuracy improves or significant movement
- **Speed Calculation**: Real-time speed and bearing calculations

## Configuration

### Location Service Settings
```java
// Update intervals
private static final long MIN_TIME_BW_UPDATES = 5000; // 5 seconds
private static final float MIN_DISTANCE_CHANGE_FOR_UPDATES = 10; // 10 meters
private static final long SHARE_INTERVAL = 10000; // 10 seconds

// Accuracy thresholds
private static final float NEARBY_STOP_DISTANCE = 100; // 100 meters
private static final float STOP_COMPLETION_DISTANCE = 50; // 50 meters
```
